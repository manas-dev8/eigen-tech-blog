        "text": "X (formerly known as Twitter) is arguably the most interesting social media platform on the Internet. It stands witness to the greatest of pranks and the greatest of meltdowns. What has been added is not exactly the most favored trait: how it is now full of pornography. You could be scrolling on X, find a good thread discussing God knows what, and just when the post ends and the comments start, find a horde of people who are ‘interested to talk to you’ with their semi-nude pictures and rather spammy accounts. It’s not that Twitter never hosted such NSFW content; it all went uphill when Elon Musk acquired the company in 2022."

And Twitter checked both of those boxes. Under Musk’s ownership, Twitter saw major layoffs in the content moderation sector and the dissolution of the Trust and Safety Council. Twitter has always had a bot problem, and these decisions certainly were not helping the users or even the company itself."

I myself have seen this as my X is mostly motorsports with politics but come face to face with ads that are talking about a political party’s manifesto and other pre-election promises. For years now, users and tech reporters have observed what they say is the real-time decay of websites, social media platforms, and search engines. Put simply, the internet sucks more now. Cory Doctorow, a tech journalist and science fiction writer, coined the term 'enshittification' as a way to describe how many of the places we populate online have been getting worse and how users aren't given many alternatives."

        "text": "It started off as experts inviting users to Facebook from MySpace and then to Instagram and Twitter and whatnot. Progressively, social media platforms go haywire and retrograde just for new platforms to replace them that in turn suffer the same fate. Max Chafkin, a senior reporter for Bloomberg Businessweek, wrote a piece about how the next big app might be just nothing, saying that social media companies gambled on the idea of endless growth and the idea that people would always be comfortable with spending a third of their days racking up screen time. 'The more time people spend on [social media], the more money the companies make. And so as a result, they're all maximizing for engagement. So this leads to a cultural problem, and then there's maybe a business problem,' he said. But this does not end here. X is reportedly testing NSFW communities where creators can have a more direct interaction with their audience and probably even monetize the same."

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Do note that though X allows NSFW content to be posted, the creators cannot monetize it and hence mostly use their X profiles to promote their streaming accounts like OnlyFans. If X were able to make Communities a successful product, it could potentially serve as a competitor to larger forum sites like Reddit and host training data for Musk’s AI-run chatbot Grok, which has exclusive access to adult content. Though this might be a dream come true for X owner Elon Musk, it will definitely be a nightmare to countless X users who do not like to have half-naked people stalking their ‘For You’ page. Given the current situation, where X itself is not batting an eye over its increasing population of not-safe-for-work bots, users are bound to either have their brains shut off expecting to come across anything unpleasant or simply leave the premises altogether."

        "text": "Since generations we have been using John von Neumann's Computer Architecture also known as Princeton Architecture proposed in 1945 which pointed out the five components of a computer system: Controller, Arithmetic unit, Memory, Input, Output. Simply put, a computer must have memory. Since then, enhancements have been made in terms of RAM, ROM, graphics, SSD, and more. But what if we say that the next generation of computers will replace this architecture? You read it correctly. Harvard Architecture, as the name suggests, was designed and invented at Harvard for the Mark 1 computer. It is a computer architecture with separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data."

What is the stored program concept? It refers to storing instructions and data simultaneously, as followed by Von Neumann's architecture. Harvard used a relay-based computer model. Does the Harvard Architecture have the von Neumann bottleneck? The shared bus between the program memory leads to the von Neumann bottleneck, which is the limited throughput between the central processing unit."

Fetching data might take 100 CPU cycles and executing instructions takes 1 cycle.The ability to do that extra cycle isn't a great improvement. Harvard Architecture mitigates this bottleneck by separating instruction and data memories. Backus talks about looking at the actual traffic on this bus. Ironically, a large part of traffic is not useful data but merely names of data, consisting of names as well as operations and data used only to compute such names."

This is because the separate memory modules allow for parallel processing, which can significantly improve system performance. Harvard Architecture improves the speed of processor operation because data and addresses do not have to share the same bus lines. The reduced size of the instruction set also speeds up decoding, and the short data path length in a single chip design reduces data transmission time. The program execution hardware uses a 'pipeline' arrangement, where one instruction is executed while the next is being fetched from program memory."

All these features contribute to a high speed of operation compared to traditional microprocessors that use a conventional Von Neumann architecture, where the program and data share the same data bus and memory space. Conclusion: HARVARD ARCHITECTURE represents the next generation in computer architecture with its phenomenal enhancements and totally new design. Not just in display, memory, and graphics but a completely new architecture. And that's HARVARD ARCHITECTURE."

              { "type": "paragraph", "text": "In an age where information overload is the norm, the ability to focus and retain knowledge has become increasingly challenging. As attention spans dwindle, the need for personalized learning experiences has never been more critical. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed content creation and consumption, particularly in relation to individual attention spans." },
              { "type": "paragraph", "text": "Research indicates that the average human attention span has decreased, They say that the average attention span is down from 12 seconds in the year 2000 to eight seconds now. That's less than the nine-second attention span of your average goldfish. But the statistics are not all that they seem - and neither is the received wisdom about goldfish. This decline is largely attributed to the rise of digital platforms and the consumption of short-form content, such as that found on TikTok and Instagram. These platforms are designed to maximize engagement through algorithms that deliver bite-sized, easily digestible content, which can lead to a preference for quick dopamine hits rather than deeper engagement with complex ideas." },
              { "type": "paragraph", "text": "AI's ability to analyse vast amounts of user data allows it to tailor content specifically to individual preferences and behaviours. This personalization means users are presented with a continuous stream of highly relevant information, which can enhance engagement but also risks creating echo chambers that limit exposure to diverse perspectives. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing, AI can generate content that aligns closely with user interests, making it more captivating and harder to resist." },
              { "type": "paragraph", "text": "As AI continues to evolve, its role in shaping how we consume information will likely expand. The ability to customize content delivery could redefine our interaction with digital media, potentially leading to a future where we rarely engage with unmodified content. However, this raises concerns about dependency on AI for content curation and the risk of further diminishing our attention spans if not managed wisely." },
              { "type": "paragraph", "text": "In conclusion, while AI presents exciting opportunities for personalized content delivery that aligns with individual attention spans, it also poses significant challenges. Striking a balance between engagement and depth will be crucial in navigating this complex landscape as we move forward in an increasingly AI-driven world." }

And I genuinely would not blame you for the same! After all, the average human attention span has decreased from 12 seconds in 2000 to 8.25 seconds today. And you might have noticed the same in your everyday life too, in minute acts you would have even ignored cause they seem so trifle!" },

And now that you think of it, it is usually because of those game clips running in the background that keep your attention fixed on that specific video and not incite you to just scroll up to see another video. This tectonic shift in social media has happened because of lack of attention retention in human. And right now, only conversations around distraction while using a digital devices are being talked about. Once you take into account the times when you were in a serious meeting or a lecture but could not stop yourself from checking your cellphone notifications, it will dawn on you how drastically humans have become prone to distractions." },
              { "type": "paragraph", "text": "Generally, one must assume that teenagers have a lot less attention span in comparison to young adults, but the stats have been affirming this concern. A study involving 262 individuals aged 7–85 found that attention spans vary by age, with children having an average attention span of 29.61 seconds, young adults around 76.24 seconds, and older adults approximately 67.01 seconds. Children experienced a significant decline in attention span during tasks, while young adults showed relatively stable attention spans." },
              { "type": "paragraph", "text": "Evidently, the culprit in a large sense is technology and digital devices. The average adult's attention span while using digital devices is now around 8.25 seconds, which is shorter than that of a goldfish (9 seconds). This decline is linked to increased screen time, which averages about 7.5 hours per day. A survey indicated that approximately half of adults believe their attention spans are diminishing due to the overwhelming amount of information available and the need for quick processing." },
              { "type": "paragraph", "text": "Naturally, one would want to mention how social media is heavily responsible for it. With the concept of ‘infinite scrolling’ available at every social media you can think of, the user is being handed a twelve course meal with the option go from one cuisine to the next in just a swipe. Even the social media dating scene is the victim to reduced attention span. Don’t like this guy? Swipe left- a more handsome one will appear out of this Pandora’s Box. And remember online education and its exciting accessibility? Boom! You can watch every video at a 2x speed to make sure you gather more information in less time and feed your goldfish attention span." },

It comes as no surprise that parents across the globe are increasingly concerned with addressing concerns over technology usage. Bearing this issue in mind, a research was conducted on the effects of the exponential increase in screen time on young children. The study found that young children are now spending a daily average of 2.5 hours watching television, a significant jump from the 1.32 hour daily average of two decades ago. While screens were limited only to televisions in 1997, by 2014, a vast array of mobile devices began making their way into the hands of children, including but not limited to: smartphones, iPads, electronic readers, and children’s learning devices. Children aged 0-2 years now spend a daily average of 2.5 hours in front of the television and an additional 0.5 hours on mobile devices, bringing their daily screen time to approximately 3 hours. For people with ADHD, it is a hellhole out there!" },
              { "type": "paragraph", "text": "Enters the twist in the tale: technology, the culprit can also be the savior! There has been a noticable rise in mindfulness applications across the Web which help users to keep their device usage to a minimum, with which their real-life-to-tech distractions can be reduced to a significant stature. When on one hand, apps like Focus@Will, Freedom, and Headspace focus on diminishing distractions caused by your dear devices by blocking them for a user-defined time or condition, digital wellness features across your smartphones make sure you can set up restrictions for applications and notifications, helping you keep your individuality irrespective of your digital devices. Such features and apps even have options under which a user would receive a notification when a certain app is being used to its user-defined time limit." },
              { "type": "paragraph", "text": "Consequentially, it all falls upon how the user is going to use their devices and the technology at disposal. It is going to be a long road for science to offer more rigid and result oriented innovation and technology to help humans deal with their diminishing attention retention, it is a sure humankind is sure to tread upon. And even though we have tech at disposal to give us fairly acceptable results, it would fall upon our own will, since we have not (yet) hardwired our brain into building up an attention span as long as a turtle’s lifespan." },

Much like a drug, it offers instant gratification in the form of likes, shares, and comments, but with potentially harmful long-term effects on mental health. For many, scrolling through feeds has become a daily habit, with every notification acting as a dose of dopamine, the 'feel-good' hormone. This 'social media drug' taps into our primal need for validation and belonging, making it incredibly difficult to put down."

This is due to a sharp increase in receptors for the 'feel-good' hormones, such as dopamine and oxytocin, in a part of the brain called the ventral striatum. As a result, compliments, social interactions, and approval from peers become much more rewarding and satisfying."

The endless, instant stream of content can lead to an overstimulation of the brain's reward systems, making it even harder to regulate the desire for validation. The compulsion to scroll for more—whether it's checking for new likes or watching another video—can contribute to heightened feelings of anxiety, loneliness, and frustration, particularly when the feedback isn't as positive as expected. For children and adolescents, this pattern can be especially problematic, as their brains are still developing and may not yet have the full capacity to manage these emotions."
